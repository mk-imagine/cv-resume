\section{Abstract}
Students majoring in computer science often have little to no computing
experience before entering college and this can affect students' confidence and
performance throughout their education~\cite{alv}.

Students majoring in computer science often have little to no computing
experience before entering college and this can affect students’ confidence and
performance throughout their education (Alvarado et al. 2018). To mitigate this
obstacle, we attempt to boost students’ confidence, reduce learning loss, and
provide foundational support by offering a four day online winter term bootcamp
as a bridge between their introductory and intermediate computer science
courses.  This is a qualitative study examining the experiences of Computer
Science students that participated.
