% University of California affirm that diversity is critical to promoting lively intellectual exchange and the variety of ideas and
% perspectives essential to advancing higher education and research. Our graduate students contribute to the global pool of future scholars
% and academic leaders, thus high value is placed on achieving a diverse graduate student body to support the University of Californiaâ€™s
% academic excellence. We invite you to include in this statement how you may contribute to the diversification of graduate education and the
% UC Davis community.

% background informs your decision to pursue a graduate degree. You may include any educational, familial, cultural, economic, or social
% experiences, challenges, community service, outreach activities, residency and citizenship, first-generation college status, or
% opportunities relevant to your academic journey; how your life experiences contribute to the social, intellectual, or cultural diversity
% within a campus community and your chosen field; or how you might serve educationally underrepresented and underserved segments of society
% with your graduate education.
