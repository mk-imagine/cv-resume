% #1 Please describe pivotal experiences, opportunities, and/or challenges (including any financial or access to education barriers) that
% have influenced your educational and professional development. (250 words max)

% As a non-traditional and older student, I have significant experiences that have influenced my educational and professional development.
% Because of this, they are too numerous to state within such a short space, so I will speak only of my experiences at SFSU.

% The greatest challenge I faced while pursuing my education was the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This extremely disruptive time had
% upended the world, and it impacted my studies and personal life.  The pandemic also compounded challenges that I was facing in my marriage,
% which ultimately led to divorce amidst the worst of it.  Navigating the separation and isolation while maintaining academic performance and
% goals were difficult beyond words.  Beyond the mental and emotional toll, the divorce drained me financially, which only compounded its
% effect on my life.  Nevertheless, as evidenced by my record, I was still able to succeed through this adversity.

% As the US was opening back up, albeit with social distancing measures in effect, I was provided with an important opportunity in an REU
% program with the University of Houston.  This fully remote program gave me my first experience with full-time academic research.  This time
% not only honed my interest in research, but also furnished me with skills in collaborating with other academics and generating actionable
% results with often ambiguous guidance.  This allowed me to further develop my skills with dealing with uncertainty and solving unstructured
% problems.

% #2 At Illinois, we value a studentâ€™s ability to contribute to a community of inclusion, belonging, and respect where our graduate students
% can learn and collaborate productively and positively. 
% Please provide an example of how you contributed to or engaged with a community of students or colleagues with different perspectives,
% abilities, and experiences to achieve a positive outcome, and reflect on what you learned from this experience. (250 words max)

By far the greatest example of my engagement and contribution to the community at SFSU would be during my time filling various leadership
roles with the Association for Computing Machinery Student Chapter.  As President, I led the post-pandemic revival of the organization,
where I built a team of amazing student leaders from friends and complete strangers, all of whom hailed from a diverse combination of
origins and cultures.  To ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment, I emphasized an imperative that our mission was to assist students
academically and professionally, while building a community of mutual support.

Our initial efforts were aimed at providing skill-building workshops (e.g. coding, technical interview, resume building) and professional
panel discussions.  Once we garnered a consistent and growing membership, we began focusing on creating specialized groups that would cater
to more specific interests such as game development, algorithms, and cyber-security.  We are often credited not for contributing to a
community of students, but building a community of students from the wreckage of the pandemic.  Today, this thriving community of students
has grown into an organization of 15 special interest groups, over 30 officers, and an active membership of over 300 students interested in
computing.

Perhaps the most important lesson that I learned is that for any movement to be sustainable, leadership must not be stagnant.  New leaders
need to be continuously identified and trained and past leaders need to "give up the mantle," especially in the context of a four year
education.
