\title{Serving a Diverse Student Body}
\author{Mark Kim}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

When I re-entered college I never expected to have an interest in serving a
college or university as a member of the faculty.  In fact, my return to school was
predicated entirely on a business idea and personal interest based on fueling
people's career decisions from latent passions that may be found through data
mining.  It wasn't until I stumbled upon an on-campus job position as an
undergraduate facilitator for a supplemental course in Computer Science that I
discovered my own zeal for teaching.  The experience was not only deeply
rewarding, but considering optimal ways to improve knowledge retention
and understanding was fascinating.  It probably should not come as a surprise
considering my preoccupation with cognition and motivation, but it was still a
revelation to me.
